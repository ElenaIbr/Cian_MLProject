## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, we analyze the residential real estate market in **Saint Petersburg, Russia** using data from [Cian.ru](https://cian.ru), one of the largest real estate platforms in the country.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts the **price per square meter** of an apartment.
